                                    <p>As the world moves on continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers of cases, deaths, and
                                        vaccinations continue to decline. In this article, I aim to take a closer look at the latest data
                                        and highlight the top countries in each category.</p>

                                    <p>The United States leads the world in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases, with over 102 million cases,
                                        followed closely by China and India. France and Germany complete the top 5 countries with the most COVID-19 cases.
                                        When it comes to COVID-19 deaths, the United States takes the top spot with over 1.1 million deaths, followed by Brazil
                                        and India. Russia and Mexico round out the top 5 countries with the most COVID-19 deaths.</p>

                                        We find that Yemen has the highest CFR at 18.1%, this is 1564 times higher than the country with the highest number of deaths - United States (CFR 1.08%) 14760 times higher than most populous country China (CFR 0.12%).
                                        <br>The highest Mortality ratio (MR) was recorded for Peru at 0.65%, this is 96.9 times higher than United States (MR 0.33%) and 6400 times higher than China (MR 0.01%).</p>

                                    <blockquote>Peru had the higher Mortality Ratio at 0.65% while Yemen had the highest Case Fatality Ratio 18.1%.</blockquote>

                                        The high COVID-related death rates in Peru and Bosnia can be attributed to a key factors, including:
                                        <ul><!--li>Healthcare system capacity: The healthcare systems in both Peru and Bosnia have been struggling to keep up with the demand for medical care during the pandemic. Limited resources, including medical personnel and equipment, have made it difficult for these countries to provide adequate care to all those affected by COVID-19.</li-->
                                        <li>Poverty: Poverty is another factor that has contributed to the high death rates in Peru and Bosnia. Many people in these countries live in poverty, and they may not have access to the medical care they need to recover from COVID-19.</li>
                                        <li>Age of the population: Both Peru and Bosnia have relatively older populations, which are more susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19.</li>
                                        <li>Chronic health conditions: Many people in both Peru and Bosnia suffer from chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. These underlying health issues can increase the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.</li>
                                    <li>Limited access to vaccines: Both countries have faced challenges in securing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines, leaving many people unprotected against the virus.</li></ul>
                                        In summary, a combination of factors, including limited healthcare system capacity, poverty, an older population, chronic health conditions, and limited access to vaccines, have contributed to the high COVID-related death rates in Peru and Bosnia.

                                    <p>CFR indicates the percentage of the cases that resulted in death. Analysing CFR values provides us with a few key insights:
                                        <ul>
                                            <!--li>11 out of the 20 countries with highest CFR values belong to one of the poorest continent - Africa</li-->
                                            <li>The available data suggests that the population of Yemen may not possess the physical or health resilience necessary to combat COVID-19 effectively.</li>
                                            <!--li>The healthcare system in Yemen has been severely affected by years of conflict, leaving it without the necessary resources to provide adequate support to the war-torn nation in this pandemic.</li-->
                                            <li>All of the countries with highest CFR have weak healthcare infrastructures, with limited resources and medical supplies. This has made it difficult to provide adequate care to COVID-19 patients, leading to higher mortality rates.</li>
                                            <li>Pre-existing health conditions: Many people in these countries suffer from pre-existing health conditions, such as malnutrition, tuberculosis, and HIV, which can increase the risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19.</li>
                                            <li>Conflict and displacement: Conflict and displacement have disrupted healthcare systems in all four countries, leaving many people without access to medical care. This has made it difficult to manage COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent fatalities.</li>
                                            <li>Limited vaccine access: Vaccine access has been limited in these countries, with many people still waiting to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This has left populations vulnerable to the virus and contributed to a higher case fatality ratio.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>In terms of Human Development Index (HDI) we take a look at countries that have endured most deaths on both ends of the spectrum (HDI > 0.9 and  HDI < 0.5). The top three countries with most deaths in rich nations (HDI > 0.9) are
                                        United States, United Kingdom followed by Germany. While in the poor nations the most deaths were seen in Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique. In this list United States (HDI 0.93) had 14650 times more deaths compared to Ethiopia (HDI 0.48).  </p>

                                        The reason Asia had more COVID-19 cases but South America had more COVID-19 deaths can be attributed to several factors, including:
                                        <ul><li>Demographics: Asia has a larger population than South America, which means that more people were likely to contract COVID-19. However, South America has a relatively older population, which is more susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19.</li>
                                        <li>Healthcare system capacity: Asia has a more robust healthcare system than South America, which means that the region was better equipped to handle the influx of COVID-19 cases. In contrast, South America's healthcare system struggled to keep up with the demand for medical care during the pandemic, leading to higher death rates.</li>
                                        <li>Variants of the virus: The different COVID-19 variants that emerged in various regions may have played a role in the disparity between cases and deaths. Some variants, such as the Alpha variant that was first detected in the UK, are more transmissible but less deadly, while others, such as the Gamma variant that was first detected in Brazil, are more deadly.</li>
                                        <li>Response measures: The response measures implemented by each region may have also contributed to the difference in cases and deaths. For example, some countries in Asia implemented strict lockdown measures and contact tracing, which helped to slow the spread of the virus. In contrast, some countries in South America were slower to implement such measures, leading to higher death rates.</li></ul>
