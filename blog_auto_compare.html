                                    <p>The automation of business processes is no longer just a luxury for larger businesses, rather it is rapidly becoming a necessary essential 
                                        for businesses of all sizes to ensure continued success.

                                        In this article we will look at what process automation means, what types of automation solutions are available, the benefits of adopting 
                                        automation and why it is so important for the future of all businesses.</p>

                                    <h3>What is automation?</h3>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>If you grab your dictionary you will find automation defined as a technique, method, or system of operating or controlling a process by highly 
                                        automatic means, as by electronic devices, reducing human intervention to a minimum. This definition is perhaps slightly confusing and wordy, 
                                        so what do we mean when talking about automation? A simpler definition, and how we see it, would be the use of software applications to automate 
                                        business processes, so employees don't have to.

                                        By replacing these, often labour intensive, processes with automation software brings many advantages, such as reduced costs, increased 
                                        efficiency and time savings - we will dive into the benefits later on.
                                        
                                        There are many different automation solutions available so lets take a look at the different type</p>

                                            BPA is more focussed on the whole business automating a workflow throughout the entire organisation rather than individual tasks.</p>

                                        <li><p><b>Scalability</b><br>Automated processes can easily adapt to changes in volume, making them highly scalable and efficient in handling increased workloads.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Improved Accuracy & consistency</b><br>Automated systems ensure that tasks are performed with a high level of precision and consistency, eliminating variations that may occur with manual execution.</p></li>
                                        <li><p><b>Faster Processing</b><br> Automated processes often work faster than manual processes, leading to quicker turnaround times and improved overall productivity.</p></li>

                                    <p>Digital Transformation is a phrase that businesses have been talking about for a long-time. Many businesses recognise the benefits that digitisation brings, but have problems keeping momentum in deploying solutions. 
                                    The main problem has always been the cost involved in developing software, which is often bespoke to each organisation.</p>
                                    
                                    <br>

                                    <p>The Covid-19 pandemic of 2020 has led to more and more businesses committing to speeding up their digital transformation plans. This is largely driven from the need for efficiency to maintain growth and, in some instances, to survive.<br>
                                        Adopting automation within these organizations is vital to driving down costs, increasing efficiency, and improves both customer and employee satisfaction. Automating manual processes, which are often paper based, helps business
                                        leaders ensure that their digital transformation targets are being met, but how do they now get around the barriers such as cost and speed of deployment?</p>
